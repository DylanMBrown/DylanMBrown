## Modern Bible App

This repository contains a very small sample web app that demonstrates how you might build a multi-translation Bible reader. The app loads sample verses from `data/bible_sample.json` and highlights words spoken by Jesus in **red** and words spoken by the Father in **blue**.

### Running

Open `index.html` in any modern web browser. Select the translation from the dropdown to view the available text. The provided sample only includes a few verses from the public domain King James Version (KJV). Other translations are left blank for you to fill in with appropriately licensed text.

### Adding Data

Edit `data/bible_sample.json` to include additional verses and translations. Use the `<jesus>...</jesus>` and `<father>...</father>` tags around phrases that should be color-coded.
